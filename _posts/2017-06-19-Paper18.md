> A rare find of a complete quasispecies


Mobile genetic elements can be found in almost all genomes. Possibly the most common non-autonomous mobile genetic elements in bacteria are REPINs that can occur hundreds of times within a genome. The sum of all REPINs in a genome can be viewed as an evolving
population because REPINs replicate and mutate. In contrast to most other biological populations, we know the exact composition of the REPIN population and the sequence of each member of the population. Here, we model the evolution of REPINs as quasispecies.
