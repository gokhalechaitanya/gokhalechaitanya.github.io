[Wolfram Demonstrations](http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/index.html) is a service offered by Wolfram, the makers of Mathematica to host interactive computable documents (CDF). 

### Interactive demonstration of the effect of multiple players on the Red King phenomena.

The demonstration is based on the paper on [mutualism and multiplayer evolutionary games]({% post_url 2012-09-12-Paper8 %}).
Here is the CDF as hosted on the [Wolfram Website](http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/MutualismAndEvolutionaryMultiplayerGamesRevisitingTheRedKing/).
You will probably need Mathematica or the [Wolfram CDF player](http://www.wolfram.com/cdf-player/) to be installed to view the following file
